                        The Washington University Nursery School was founded in 1947 as a
                        cooperative venture of faculty and Washington University in St.
                        Louis. The primary purpose of the nursery school is to provide the
                        highest quality preschool program for children 2 years and 7
                        months to 5 years of age. Today about 70 percent of the children
                        are from families of Washington University in St. Louis faculty,
                        staff and students, and the remaining are from families in the
                        community.

                        Children come from a variety of countries, cultures and
                        economic
                        backgrounds.&nbsp;The school maintains the high standards of the
                        National Association for the Education of Young Children, by
                        which&nbsp;it&nbsp;is accredited. It is licensed by the State of
                        Missouri.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nursery school also serves as a site for research in child
                        development and early childhood teacher training. Washington
                        University undergraduate and graduate students are employed to
                        assist in the classrooms. The classroom teachers, as well as the
                        nursery school’s director, supervise them. The student workers’
                        presence enables children to receive additional individual
                        attention.

                        The nursery school is located on the Washington University campus.
                        It is composed of three classrooms which are designed to offer
                        children a variety of choices in their play. Two additional
                        all-purpose rooms are equipped with a library and a variety of
                        indoor gross motor play materials.&nbsp;A large outdoor play area
                        gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide
                        and play in the sand.

                        I cannot say enough good things about WUNS. We feel extremely
                        lucky to have discovered your nursery school. The staff is
                        dedicated, well-trained and (most of all) cares deeply for the
                        children. The other families are warm and welcoming, and their
                        diversity will hopefully serve as a baseline for...what the
                        world should look like.

                        It’s wonderful to feel like your child’s caregivers are better
                        at the job than you are; truly, on the whole they are more
                        patient, better able to see the forest for the trees, certainly
                        more trained and aware of what’s developmentally appropriate

                        There are many benefits, but problem-solving and being a good
                        friend are two of the important things our child is learning at
                        WUNS. In small ways–through play, stories, outings, activities
                        and pictures–there is so much learning taking place at WUNS
                        (great for all abilities and learning styles). WUNS is a diverse
                        environment with many opportunities to learn about other
                        cultures, customs, foods and traditions that our (child) most
                        likely wouldn’t have been exposed to elsewhere.

                        Our child loves every minute! He has grown and developed in
                        confidence. Teachers allow him to grow at his own pace and work
                        with our family in ways that we find incredible.

                        trouble about going to school. He couldn’t wait to see his
                        teachers every day. I feel that the teachers helped my child
                        build self-confidence and improve his language skills. I am 100%
                        happy with our nursery school choice.

                        the school and enjoy the education there.
