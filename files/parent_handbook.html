      <p><strong>Welcome</strong></p>
      <p>
        <p><em>Dear	Parents	and	Guardians,</em></p>
        <p><em>At	the	Nursery	School	we	strive	to	provide	a	great	learning	environment	for	each	and	every	
          child	in	our	care.	We	recognize	that	a	strong	partnership	with	parents	and	clarity	about	
          expectations	for	how	we	will	work	together	in	this	effort	are	critical.	Please	take	time	to	read	
          through	this	Parent	Handbook	and	to	familiarize	yourself	with	its	content.	It	provides	
          important	information	and	helpful	guidance.	We	ask	parents	to	know	and	follow	the	
          procedures	and	rules	contained	in	this	Handbook.	We	hope	it	will	become	your	go-to	source	for	
          information.</em></p>	
        <p><em>Nikki	Scheele,	Director</em></p></p>
      <p>At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	every	child	is	a	unique	individual	
        with	his	or	her	own pattern	and	timetable	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual	and	physical	
        growth.</p>
      <p>We	believe	in	learning	through	play;	we	provide	fun,	child-centered	activities	that	effectively	
        engage	students.	We	encourage	creativity	in	all	areas	with	a	special	focus	on	the	arts	to	
        enhance	language	and	thinking.	Above	all,	our	goals	are	that	children	will	develop	a	genuine	
        pleasure	in	learning,	that	they	develop	confidence	in	their	ability	to	learn	and	to	accomplish	
        challenging	tasks	and	that	they	gain	experience	and	skills	in	interacting	with	others.</p>
      <p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>
      <p>Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
        catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
        provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
        developmental	areas.</p>
      <p>The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
        approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
        consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
        children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
        class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
        the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
        music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
        and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program.</p>

      <p><strong>Vision Statement</strong></p>
      <p>Washington	University Nursery School values	children	for	their	wonder	and	curiosity,	their	ideas	and	creativity,	and	their	
        delight	in	play. We value	families	for	their	traditions	and	goals,	their	commitment	to	home,	work,	play,	
        community,	and	their	dreams	for	their	children. We value	teachers	for	their	vision,	their	job	in	children’s	play	and	achievements,	their	
        flexibility	and	skill,	and	their	commitment	and	compassion.		We	support	and	respect	
        what	we	learn	from	each	other</p>

      <p><strong>Parent	School	Partnership</strong></p>
      <p>When	joined	by	a	common	set	of	beliefs	and	purposes,	a	school	and	its	parents	form	a	
        powerful	team	with	far-reaching positive	effects	on	children	and	the	entire	school	
        community.	As	a	result,	WUNS	relies	on	its	parents	to	understand	and	embrace	the	School’s	
        philosophy	and	values,	and	fully	support	its	curriculum,	teachers/staff,	and	administration.	
        Working	together,	parents	and	school	professionals	exert	a	strong	influence	on	children’s	
        development	and	help	them	to	mature	by	modeling	healthy	adult	working	relationships	
        based	on	honesty,	trust,	civility,	and	mutual	respect.	The	teachers,	staff,	and	administration	
        of	WUNS	share	our	parents’	commitment	to	their	children	and	join	them	in	partnership	
        dedicated	to	the	growth	of	each	child.	This	partnership	begins	with	timely,	honest	and	open	
        communication	between	home	and	school,	and	is	premised	on	an	assumption	of	goodwill	
        and a	shared	interest	in	what	is	best	for	each	individual	child.	Parents	can	best	support	this	
        climate	of	trust	and	respect	by	communicating	concerns	openly	and	constructively	to	the	
        teacher.	If	a	satisfactory	conclusion	is	not	reached,	the	parent	should	then contact	the	
        Director.	Out	of	respect	for	the	individual	needs	and	privacy	of	each	family,	the	Nursery	
        School places	a	high	value	on	confidentiality	and	expects	individual	families	to	honor	the	
        same.	Efforts	to	lobby	other	parents	are	contrary	to	the	spirit	of	the	Parent	School	
        Partnership.	By	enrolling	their	child(ren)	in	WUNS,	parents	agree	to	support	the	School’s	
        vision,	follow	its	rules	and	policies,	and	abide	by	its	decisions.	Just	as	parents	can	expect	the	
        Nursery	School to	share	timely	information	and	concerns	with	families	concerning	their
        child,	so	too	the	Nursery	School	expects	parents	to	approach	issues	and	concerns	in	a	spirit	
        of	mutual	goodwill,	using	proper	channels,	and	in	a	manner	that	gives	everyone	the	benefit	of	
        the	doubt	and	leads	to	collaborative	and	constructive	solutions.	While	parents	may	not	agree	
        with	every	decision,	in	most	cases,	the	parents	and	Nursery	School	will	find	enough	common	
        ground	to	continue	a	mutually	respectful	and	productive	relationship.	However,	when	it	is	
        clear	that	a	constructive,	positive	relationship	cannot	be	maintained,	the	School	reserves	the	
        right	to	deny	continued	attendance	or	re-enrollment.	</p>
      
      <p><strong>History</strong></p>
      <p>The	Washington	University	Nursery	School	was	founded	in	1947	as	a	cooperative	venture	of	
        faculty	and	Washington	University	in	St.	Louis.	The	primary	purpose	of	the	nursery	school	is	
        to	provide	the	highest	quality	preschool	program	for	children	2	years	and	7	months	to	5	
        years	of	age.	Today	about	70	percent	of	the	children	are	from	families	of	Washington	
        University	in	St.	Louis	faculty,	staff	and	students, and	the	remaining	are	from	families	in	the	
        community.</p>
      <p>Children	come	from	a	variety	of	countries,	cultures	and	economic	backgrounds. The	school	
        maintains	the	high	standards	of	the	National	Association	for	the	Education	of	Young	
        Children,	by	which it is	accredited.	It	is	licensed	by	the	State	of	Missouri.
        The	nursery	school	also	serves	as	a	site	for	research	in	child	development.	Washington	
        University	undergraduate	and	graduate	students	are	employed	to	assist in	the	classrooms.	
        The	classroom	teachers,	as	well	as	the	nursery	school’s	director,	supervise	them.	The	student	
        workers’	presence	enables	children	to	receive	additional	individual	attention.</p>
      <p>The	nursery	school	is	located	on	the	Washington	University	campus.	It	is	composed	of	three	
        classrooms, which	are	designed	to	offer	children	a	variety	of	choices	in	their	play.	Two	
        additional	all-purpose	rooms	are	equipped	with	a	library	and	a	variety	of	indoor	gross	motor	
        play	materials. A	large	outdoor	play	area	gives	children	the	opportunity	to	run,	bike,	swing,	
        climb,	slide	and	play	in	the	sand.</p>

      <p><strong>Staff</strong></p>
      <p>The	staff	at	the	nursery	school	respects	and	appreciates	the	talents	and	personalities	of	each	
        child	and	his	or	her	family.	A	teacher’s	individual	talents	are	also	encouraged	as	she	or	he	
        develops	his	or	her	own	personal	approach	in	the	classroom.	This	makes	for	a	vibrant,	
        growing	community	of	children,	families	and	teachers.</p>
      <p>In	general,	teachers	hold	a	Bachelor	or	Master	degree	in	early	childhood or	elementary
        education	and/or	teaching.		All	have	extensive	early	childhood	teaching	experience.
        Professional	development	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.		The	school	pays	fees	for	
        workshops	and	conferences	during	the	year.		In	addition,	there	are	two teacher	in-service	
        days	and	monthly	staff	meetings.		All	teachers	are	certified	in CPR	and	First	Aid.</p>

      <h2 id="classroom-info">Classroom Information</h2>
      <p>Our	classes focus	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Each	year’s	class	builds	
        on	the	previous	year’s	program	in	curriculum	experiences	and	activities	offered.	The	
        classrooms	are	set	up	to	invite	exploration	and	foster	a	lifelong	love	of	learning.	Our	staff	is	
        deeply	committed	to	the	young	child	and	the	importance	of	early	childhood	education.</p>
      <p><strong>Two’s/Young	Three’s:</strong>	 Children	must	turn	3 by	February	1	of	that	school	year.	The	focus	of	
        this	class	is	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Separating	from	parents,	
        learning	to	take	direction,	and	being	nurtured	by	people	outside	of	immediate	family	are	
        important	milestones	for this	age.	The	building	of	trust	and	growing	peer	awareness	are	
        enhanced	by	a	safe	environment	that	provides	a	foundation	for	learning.		</p>
      <p><strong>Three’s/Young	Four’s:</strong>	The	emphasis	in	this class	is	to	encourage	further	socialization	by	
          reinforcing	how	a	child’s	choices	affect	their	relationships	and	environment.	There	are	
          greater	expectations	for	participation	and	appropriate	play	practices.	This	class	fosters	
          independence,	creativity,	cognitive	growth,	and	motor	coordination.	Children	are	introduced	
          to	phonemic	awareness,	patterning,	number	sequencing	with	value	recognition	and	
          following	both	verbal	and	visual	directions.</p>
      <p><strong>Four’s/Young	Five’s:</strong>	The	intent	of	this	class	is	to	further	support	the	development	of	social	
        awareness,	emotional	intelligence,	and	Kindergarten	readiness	skills.	Critical	thinking,	
        science,	sequencing,	sorting	and	classification,	matching,	number	values,	phonemic	
        awareness,	problem	solving,	storytelling	and	following	multi-step	directions	are	all	
        incorporated	in	our	curriculum.	Children	develop	their	gross	and	fine	motor	skills	while	
        working	in	large	and	small	groups.	Through	play	and	collaborative	group	work,	children
        come	to	appreciate	the	value	of	cooperation	and	contribution.	The	children	are	encouraged	
        to	take	risks,	helping	them	discover	how	the	process	of	learning	is	often	more	valuable	than	
        the	outcome.	Mastering	appropriate	academic	skills	and	fostering	social	emotional	growth	
        are	the	cornerstones	of	this	program.	</p>
      <p><strong>Bear Tracks: </strong>The	Bear	Tracks	program	provides	an	extension	of	classroom	activities	for	children	who	are	
        enrolled	in	the	half-day	program. Children	who	attend	Bear	Tracks	are	ready	for	more	than	
        half-day	classes	but	perhaps	not	full-day	schedules.
        Bear	Tracks is	offered	Tuesday	through	Friday,	9:45	a.m.	– 12:30	p.m.,	for	afternoon	students
        and	Monday	through	Friday,	11:45	a.m.	– 2:30	p.m.,	for	morning	students.	Parents	may	enroll	
        their	children	for	participation	in	Bear	Tracks	for	any	or	all	days	it	is	offered.</p>
      <p>In	addition	to	free	choice,	outdoor	time	and	a	snack,	the	daily	Bear	Tracks	schedule	includes	
        a	special	activity.	These	activities	are	designed	to	engage	a	smaller,	multi-age	group	of	
        children	in	hands-on	learning	in	a	specialized content	area,	such	as	art,	science,	movement	or	
        literacy.	Bear	Trackers,	for	example,	might	take	a	nature hike	one	day,	create	an	art	project	
        the	next, or	dramatize	a	story in	any	particular week.
        The	main	goal	for	the	Bear	Tracks	program	is	to	continue	the	progress	children	are	making	
        in	their	regular	classroom	within	a	varied	and	creative	curriculum.	Children	must	be	toilet-trained	to	enroll	in	Bear	Tracks.</p>

      <h2 id="h-s-comm">Home	and	School	Communication</h2>
      <p><strong>Orientation	Day</strong></p>
      <p>This	visiting	day	is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
        opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
        hour.		It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
        overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.</p>
      <p>The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
        orientation	schedule).		The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
        Thursday.		This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
        before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday.</p>
      <p><strong>Parent-Staff	Communication</strong></p>
      <p>Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
        give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
        emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
        concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
        or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.	</p>
      <p><strong>Assessment	and	Parent-Teacher	Conferences</strong></p>
      <p>Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
        conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers	
        keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
        development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
        writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
        in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	</p>
      <p>The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
        informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
        more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
        time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers</p>


      <h2 id="discipline">Discipline</h2>
      <p>The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
        for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers	
        to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.		Our	
        rule	of	thumb	is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	the	toys	at	school	
        safe.	</p>
      <p>The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of	
        appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can	
        stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult	
        the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn	
        their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	
        more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will	
        lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer</p>

      <p>Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	the	
        children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
        learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done	
        through:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Positive	reinforcement.</li>
        <li>Anticipating	unhealthy	social	interaction.</li>
        <li>Re-direction:		guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,	socially	positive	activities.</li>
        <li>Naming	and	validating	child’s	feelings</li>
        <li>Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	respectful	and	constructive	manner</li>
        <li>Simple,	logical	and	immediate	consequences.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When	inappropriate	behavior	is	a	continuing	problem, the	school	will	work	with	parents	to	
        understand	the	issue	and	make	appropriate	recommendations.		It	is	our	goal	to	make	school	
        a	positive,	rewarding	and	enjoyable	experience	for	each	child.		We	realize, however,	that	we	
        cannot	meet	the	needs	of	all	children	and	parents.		If	it	is	determined	that	a	child	is	not	
        growing	from	his/her	preschool	experience	at	the	Nursery	School, a	discussion	will	be	held	
        with	parents	at	which	it	may	be	decided	that	this	program	is	not	appropriate	for	the	child.		
        The	director	and	teachers	will	make	recommendations	of	other	preschool	programs	and	
        relevant	community	services	if	parents	so	desire.</p>

      <h2 id="specialized-help">Personalized Help</h2>
      <p>The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
        an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
        meet students’ needs. </p>
      <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
        of ways, which may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
          process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
        <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
        <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
        <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
        <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
          order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
        <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
          concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="p-t-conf">Parent-Teacher Conferences</h2>
      <p>Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
        students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
        group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
        informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
        and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
        Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
        curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
        child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
        read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.</p>

      <h2 id="policies-procedures">Policies and Procedures</h2>
      <p><strong>Parking</strong></p>
      <p>Free	parking	is	available	adjacent	to	the	Nursery	School.		These	three, 30-minute	spots	are	
        typically	available	during	the	school	day.		Parking	in	Zone	3	is	only	permitted	with	a	Yellow	
        Zone	3	parking	pass.		Parents	and	visitors	wishing	to	have a longer	visit	should	park	in	the	
        Millbrook	or	Snow	Way	parking	garages,	located	off	Throop	Drive	and	Snow	Way.		Visitor	
        parking	in	these	lots	is	$2.00	for	the	first	two hours.		The	Nursery	School	will	provide	
        validation	tickets	to	parents	that	park	in	the	garage	for	special	school	events.</p>
      <p><strong>Clothing</strong></p>
      <p>It	is	recommended	that	children	be	dressed	in	play	clothes	that	are	comfortable,	washable,	
        and	suitable	for	activities	both	indoors	and	outdoors.		Children	need	to	have	at	least	one	
        extra	set	of	clothing	appropriate	to	the	season	that	can	be	kept	at	school.	Parents	should	be	
        aware	of	weather conditions	and	dress	children	accordingly,	as	outdoor	play	is	an	integral	
        part	of	the	daily	schedule.		During	the	winter	months	our	general	guideline	for	outdoor	play	
        is	that	we	will	usually	go	outside	when	it	is	above	20	degrees,	with	wind	chill	taken	into	
        account.		Please	mark	your	child’s	name	in	permanent	marker	on	all	clothing	so	that	it	can	be	
        easily	identified.</p>
      <p><strong>Snacks</strong></p>
      <p>The	nursery	school	provides	a	healthy	snack	each	day	for	the	children.	Fresh	fruit	(apples,	
        oranges,	pears,	bananas,	melons,	etc.)	are	purchased	each	week	and	kept	in	the	“children’s	
        refrigerator.”	There	are	a	wide	variety	of	crackers	(soda,	graham,	Ritz,	Goldfish,	etc.)	
        available.	Snack	time	consists	of	a	fruit,	crackers	and	water.	The	older	children	learn	to	pour	
        their	own	water.</p>
      <p><strong>Birthday Celebrations</strong></p>
      <p>We	celebrate	each	child’s	birthday	(or	half-birthday	for	children	with	summer	dates).		If	
        desired,	talk	with	your	child’s	teacher	about	bringing	a	special	snack	to	share	with	the	class.</p>
      <p><strong>Holidays</strong></p>
      <p>We	are	fortunate	to	have	diverse	cultures	and	religious	beliefs	in	our	nursery	school	
        community.		Our	policy	is	to	celebrate	family	traditions,	not	the	religious	aspects,	of	holidays.</p>
      <p><strong>Field Trips</strong></p>
      <p>Teachers	frequently	plan	short	walking	trips	on	campus.		Occasionally,	trips	are	planned	offcampus	to	further	enhance	the	children’s	experiences.		Each	time	an	off-campus	trip	is
        planned,	parents	will	be	notified	in	advance	and	required	to	sign	a	form	granting	permission	
        for	the	child’s	participation</p>
      <p><strong>Medication</strong></p>
      <p>The	nursery	school	encourages	parents	to administer	medications	at	home	and	not at	school.		
        The	nursery	school	staff	does	not	routinely	administer	medications	to	the	children.		Also,	we	
        do	not	apply sunscreen	or	insect	repellent.		Medication	that	absolutely	needs	to	be	
        administered	during	school	hours	must	be	cleared	with	the	director</p>
      <p><strong>Allergies</strong></p>
      <p>If	your	child	has	a	known	allergic	reaction,	this	must	be	documented	on	the	child’s	History	
        and	Health	Record	kept	in	his/	her	file	in	the	office.		Also,	please	report	these	allergies	to	the
        classroom	teachers.		For	your	child’s	safety,	these	allergies	will be	posted	in	your	child’s	
        classroom.		If	you	object	to	this	information	being	posted,	please	contact	the	director.		In	case	
        of	severe	allergies	such	as	to	bee	stings or	nuts,	an	EpiPen	Injector	Kit	may	be	kept	at	the	
        nursery	school	and	used	by	the	director	and/or	teachers	who	are	trained	in	its	
        administration.		This	is	stored	in	the	emergency	backpack in	the	child’s	classroom.		Each	
        classroom	has	a	First	Aid	Kit	that	includes	the	EpiPen	(if	required).		This,	along	with	
        emergency	medical	forms	for	every	child,	accompanies	the	classes	on	all	walking	or	driving	
        field	trips</p>
      <p><strong>Peanut	and	Tree	Nut	Policy</strong></p>
      <p>A	growing	number	of	children	deal	with	food	allergies	and,	specifically, potentially	lifethreatening	peanut	and	tree	nut	allergies.	 Washington	University	Nursery	School	will	be	a	
        peanut- and	tree	nut-free (Brazil	nuts,	almonds,	cashews,	pistachios,	walnuts,	pecans,	and	
        hazelnuts) preschool	beginning	with	the	2017-2018	school	year.	 The	full	explanation	of	
        the Peanut	and	Tree	Nut	Policy describes	how	teachers	and	families	will	support	the	efforts	
        of	safeguarding	the	health	and	safety	of	the	children.</p>
      <p><strong>Accidents</strong></p>
      <p>The	nursery	school	makes	every	effort	to	ensure	the	safety	of	all	children.		However,	should	a	
        serious	accident	occur,	a	parent	is	immediately	contacted.		If	parents	and	emergency	contacts	
        cannot	be	reached,	we	will	take	your	child	to	the	hospital	designated	on	your	enrollment	
        form.		Minor	injuries	will	be	reported	to	you	by	your	child’s	teacher	at	pick-up.	All	injuries	
        will	also	be	reported	in	written	form	and	given	to	you	at	pickup	time.	We	will	ask	you	to	sign	
        an	identical	form	to	be	placed in	your	child’s	file	at	school.</p>
      <p><strong>Health Policy</strong></p>
      <p>The	nursery	school	makes	a	great	effort	to	provide	a	healthy	environment	for	your	children.		
        We	work	diligently	on	forming	healthy	habits	such	as	washing	hands	before	eating	or	
        handling	food,	and	after	toileting.		Our	dishes	and	cups	are	put	through	a	dishwasher/	
        sanitizer	to	sterilize	them	and	to	prevent	the	spread	of	germs.		The	rooms	are	thoroughly cleaned	daily	and	checked	for	safety.		However,	despite	everyone’s	best	efforts,	children	and	
        adults	will	get	sick.		It	is	an	expected	part	of	life.		If	children	become	ill	at	school,	they	will	be	
        cared	for	in	the	office	until	a	parent	can	pick	them	up.		</p>
      <p>Parents	are	requested	to	keep	their	child	home	in	the	event	of	the	diseases	or	symptoms	
        noted	below.		The	child	will	be	allowed	to	return	to	school	when	he	or	she	has	been	free	of	
        these	symptoms	and	has	not	required	medication	for	a	minimum	of	24	hours.		If	a	symptom	
        persists	(such	as	rash	or	cough),	or	if	a	communicable	disease	is	confirmed	(measles,	chicken	
        pox,	etc.),	returning	to	school	may	require	a	statement	from	the	child’s	physician	declaring	
        that	the	condition	is	no	longer	contagious.	</p>
      <p>PLEASE	CALL	the	nursery	school	to	inform	us	that	your	child	is	sick,	especially	if	he/	she	has	
        a	communicable	disease.		Communicable diseases	or	conditions	include: strep	throat, chicken	pox, measles,
        mumps, impetigo, conjunctivitis, hepatitis	A, diarrheal	diseases, lice, scabies, pinworm, ringworm, or
        certain	other	viral	or	bacterial	infections</p>
      <p>Also,	the	following	symptoms	could	indicate a	contagious	disease: fever, lethargy,
        diarrhea, sore	throat, vomiting, reddened,	weeping	eyes, skin	eruptions	/	rashconstant	sneezing	/	productive	cough, or
        runny	nose</p>
      <p>If	your	child	is	exposed	to	or	contracts	a	communicable	disease,	it	is	essential	that	you call	
        the	nursery	school	to	tell	us.		In	turn,	we	will	send	a	letter	home	to	inform	parents	that	your	
        child	has	been	exposed	to	a	communicable	disease.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Drop-Off	and	Pick-Up</strong></p>
      <p>All	traffic	for	arrival	and	dismissal	must	proceed	from	the	parking	lot	entrance	west	of	the	
        school,	driving	east	and	stopping	at	the	school	entrance.	Drivers	stay	in	their	cars	and 
        teachers	help	the	children	enter	and	exit.	Teachers	are	outside	for	arrival	of	children	at	8:50	
        a.m.	for	the	morning	session	and	12:30 p.m.	for	the	afternoon	session.		At	no	time	should	
        your	child	be	allowed	to	exit	your	car	without	a	teacher	present.		If	you	arrive	late,	you	must	
        escort	your	child	to	the	classroom.		At	dismissal	(11:45	a.m.	and	3:15	p.m.)	children	assemble	
        outside	the	front	door	on	benches	or,	in	inclement	weather,	inside	the	front	door.		The	
        teachers	bring	children	to	their	cars.		No	child	can	be	dismissed	to	anyone	other	than	persons	
        designated	(in	writing)	by the	parents.	Your	child	must	hold	hands	with	a	teacher	or	parent	
        when	in	front	of	the	school	in	the	drop-off/pick-up	area.</p>
      <p><strong>Emergency	Procedures</strong></p>
      <p>We	have	effective,	campus-supported	policies	at	the	Nursery	School	to	keep	your	children	
        safe.	Below	you	will	find	our	Emergency	Procedures.	We	have	a	safety	drill	each	month,	and	
        all	staff	is	informed	of	procedures,	locations	of	first	aid	kits	and	emergency	medications,	and	
        emergency	meeting	locations.</p>
      
      <p><strong>In	case	of	fire:</strong></p>
      <p>Short	bell	rings	alert	you	to	a	fire	or	drill. Close	doors	and	evacuate	in	a	calm	manner	through	the	nearest	exit,	as	designated	on	
        our	evacuation	map. Stay	in	the	designated	outdoor	area	until	cleared	to	reenter.</p>
      <p><strong>In	case	of	severe	weather:</strong></p>
      <p>One	long	continuous	bell	ring	alerts	you	to	severe	weather,	i.e.	tornado	threat. Take	shelter	under	tables	or	in	a	hallway	or	bathroom.
      Assume	tornado	position	when	threat	is	imminent. Stay	in	the	designated	area	until	cleared	to	reenter	classrooms.</p>
      <p><strong>In	case	of	lockdown:</strong></p>
      <p>If	the	WU	Emergency	Alert	System	is	activated	and	announces,	“Go	to	secure	area”	a	
        whistle	will	be	blown. Children	will	be	moved	out	of	sight	to	the	designated	safe	area	in	the	school.
        Teachers	will	have	cell	phones	to	get	emergency	information	from	the	WU	Emergency	
        headquarters	to	follow	accordingly. No	one	will	be	permitted	to	enter	or	leave	the	building	unless	evacuation	is	necessary.
        If	possible,	an	emergency	email/text	will	be	sent	out	explaining	the	circumstance. Lockdown	will	continue	until	the	school	receives	an	“all	clear”	signal	from	WU	
        emergency	personnel.</p>
      <p><strong>Parent	Notification	Procedure:</strong></p>
      <p>Parents	will	be	notified	of	campus	emergencies	and	evacuations	through	the WUSTL	
        Mobile	app,	which	is	the	fastest	and	easiest	way	for	anyone	— with	or	without	a	
        Washington	University	email	address	— to	receive	emergency	alerts.	The	app	is	
        available	for iOS or Android. Note	that	it	is	important	that	you	enable	push	
        notifications	to	receive	alerts. The	school	has	an	emergency	preparedness	bag	easily	accessible	with	all	contact	
        information,	allergy	information,	and	other	necessities. WUNS	staff	will	attempt	to	send	out	an	emergency	email/text	explaining	the	situation	
        as	much	as	possible,	as	a	follow	up	to	the	all-campus	emergency	alert.</p>
      <p><strong>Inclement Weather</strong></p>
      <p>The	nursery	school,	as	a	department	within Washington	University,	follows	the	university	
        policy	for	school	closings	as	a	result	of	inclement	weather.	It	is university policy	that	faculty	
        and	staff	members	should	report	to	work	and	leave	work	at	their	regularly	scheduled	times.	
        Should	weather	conditions	create	potentially	hazardous	travel,	the	vice	chancellor	for	human	
        resources	will	evaluate	the	severity	of	the	situation	and,	in	consultation	with	the	executive	
        vice	chancellors,	determine	the	appropriate	measures	to	be	taken.	Factors	to	be	considered	
        will	include	the	safety	of	our	faculty,	staff	and	students	as	well	as	the services	that	must	be	
        provided	despite	the	severe	weather.	 In	the	event	that	the	decision	is	made	to	dismiss	
        employees	early,	the	staff	of	the	Office	of	Human	Resources	will	contact	the	various	executive	
        vice	chancellors,	vice	chancellors	and	deans,	who, in	turn,	will	be	responsible	for	
        communicating	this	decision	to	faculty	and	staff	members. A	nursery	school	staff	member	
        would	then	relay	that	decision	to	the	parent	community	via	phone	and/or	email.</p>
      <p><strong>Referral	Process	for	Children	with	Special	Needs</strong></p>
      <p>It	is	the	policy	at	the	nursery	school	that	after	school	is	underway	and	teachers	have	had	time	
        to	observe	children	in	the	classroom,	a	teacher	who	feels	help	is	needed	in	understanding	the	
        behavior	of	a	child	in	the	classroom	will	ask	the	director	to	come and	observe.	After	
        reviewing	our	observations,	we	schedule	an	appointment	with	the	parents	to	discuss	the	
        school	behavior.	In	the	course	of	that	meeting,	we	may	request	that	a	community	
        professional	evaluate	the	child	in	the	classroom.	This	observation	may	result	in	a	request	for	
        further	evaluation.	If	needed,	community	facilities	that	better	serve	the	child’s	needs	may	be	
        recommended	to	the	parents.</p>
      <p><strong>Confidentiality	Statement</strong></p>
      <p>The	records	kept	on	families	enrolled	at	the	nursery	school	are	confidential.	Staff	may	not	
        share	information	on	file	with	others	without	written	permission	from	a	parent	or	guardian.	
        Information	received	while	in	the	performance	of	duties,	either	written	or	verbal,	shall	also	
        be	considered	confidential	and	shall	be	treated	the	same	as	written	information	contained	in	
        the	child’s	file.</p>
      <p>The	nursery	school	adheres	to	the	Code	of	Ethics	created	by	the	National	Association	for	the	
        Education	of	Young	Children	(NAEYC).	This	document	provides	guidelines	for	responsible	
        behavior	and	establishes	a	common	ground	for	early	childhood	professionals	to	resolve	
        ethical	and	moral	issues	encountered	in	daily	practice.	The	foundation	for	the	Code	of	Ethics	
        is	a	commitment	to	quality	early	childhood	practices,	including	providers’	goals	to: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Appreciate	childhood	as	a	unique,	valuable	part	of	the	human	life.</li>
          <li>Base	program	practices	on	knowledge	of	child	development.</li>
          <li>Appreciate	and	support	the	child/family	bond.</li>
          <li>Understand	children	in	the	context	of	their	family,	culture	and	society.</li>
          <li>Respect	the	uniqueness	and worth	of	children,	family	members	and	colleagues.</li>
          <li>Develop	helpful	relationships	based	on	trust,	respect	and	positive	regard.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <h2 id="special-programs">Special	Programs</h2>
      <p><strong>School	Picnic</strong></p>
      <p>Families	are	invited	to	a	school	gathering	at	the	beginning	and	end	of	the	school	year.	
        “Popsicles	at	the	Park”	is	held	the	week	prior	to	school	starting.		This	fun	family	event	at	
        Shaw	Park	allows	children	and	parents	to	get	acquainted	with	new	classmates	and	their	
        teachers.		The	last	week	of	school	families	gather	for	a	dinner/potluck	at	Shaw	Park	to	
        celebrate	the	culmination	of	the	year.</p>
      <p><strong>Open	House</strong></p>
      <p>In	October,	WUNS	holds	an	“open	house”	for	current	children	and	their	families.		This	event	
        allows	parents	and	siblings	to	visit	the	child’s	classroom,	meet	the	teachers	and	play	on	the	
        playground.		Children	are	excited	to	“show-off”	their	school	to	their	family.	</p>
      <p><strong>After-School	Playdates</strong></p>
      <p>We	arrange	times	throughout	the	year	to	have	the	WUNS	playground	open	after	school	from	
        3:15-5:00	p.m.		so	children	and	their	families	can	play.			Siblings	are	welcome	to	join.		All	
        children	must	have	a	parent	or	caregiver	present	to	attend.	</p>
      <p><strong>Halloween Parade</strong></p>
      <p>Parents	are	invited	to	our	annual	Halloween	parade	followed	by	songs	and	snack	in	their	
        child’s	classroom.		An	invitation	and	details	will	be	shared	with	all	parents.</p>
      <p><strong>Donuts	with	Dads	and	Muffins	with	Moms</strong></p>
      <p>Parents	are	invited	to	enjoy	time	to	play	in	the	classroom	and	a	special	snack	with	their	
        preschoolers	during	these	special	days	(fall	and	spring).		Children	will	bring	home	invitations	
        and	details	about	each	event.	</p>
      <p><strong>Dine	Out	Nights</strong></p>
      <p>The	Nursery	School	partners	with local	restaurants	to	provide	social	gatherings for	families.		
        On	these	Dine	Out	Nights,	families	and	friends	are	encouraged	to	eat	out	at	the	designated	
        restaurant.		Families	enjoy	having	a	meal	with	fellow	WUNS	classmates	and	parents,	while	
        also	supporting	the	Nursery	School.</p>
      <p><strong>Night	at	the	Magic	House</strong></p>
      <p>In	February,	the	Nursery	School	rents	the	early	childhood	section	of	the	Magic	House	for	
        Nursery	School	families.		This	special	night	is	a	huge	hit	with	everyone.		Parents	can	enjoy	a	
        private	night	at	their	child’s	favorite hands-on museum!</p>
      <p><strong>Annual	Parent	Social</strong></p>
      <p>In	early	spring,	parents	are	invited	to	a	“parent-only”	social	event.		In	the	past	it	has	been	a	
        trivia	night,	gallery	night	(highlighting	preschooler’s	artwork),	and/or	silent	auction.	 Monies	
        raised	help	support	our	enrichment	programs	– Art,	Spanish,	Nature	and	Music,	as	well	as	
        specific	equipment	or	school	needs.</p>
